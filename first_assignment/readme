to run the code:

catkin_make in root folder

rosrun stage_ros stageros $(rospack find assignment1)/world/exercise.world 

rosrun first_assignment random_target

rosrun first_assignment reach_target

in the package i'm using the following nodes:
random_target- this is the node i created to handle the service

reach_target- this is the node i created to handle the subscriber, the publisher and the client 
for the service

stageros- this node is used by the simulation

rosout- this node is used for the output to screen

computational graph of the system: 
we can see that the node reach_target has both a subscriber and a publisher in the node stageros. 
The random_target server is broadcasting a message and the reach_target can read it with is client.
